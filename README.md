This is simple function which prints different strings depending on the
location of the HTTP request.

It makes use of the MaxMind GeoIP API for PHP.
See [https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-php](github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-php)
for more details about the API.

## Installation

The MaxMind API was installed here via Composer, and is included in this package.
If you're already using composer, change the require line in example.php
to match the location of your Composer autoload file.

For example, change:

    require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

To:

    require_once '/path/to/composer/autoload.php';

## Usage

Coming soon. In the meantime, see the example.php file. It should be pretty straight forward.

## Full Example

You can see an example in the example.php file. For convenience, it will be reprinted here soon.

## Suggestions

This was built for a client, and you're seeing the vanilla version here.
